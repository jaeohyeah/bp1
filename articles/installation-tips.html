      <h2>Installation Tips for Beginners</h2>
      <p>Installing a bypass oil filter might sound tricky, but don't worry! Think of it like adding a helper to your engine that keeps the oil super clean. Let's walk through the steps together.</p>

      <h3>What You'll Need</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Bypass oil filter kit (like AMSOIL or Frantz)</li>
        <li>Wrenches and screwdrivers</li>
        <li>Oil catch pan</li>
        <li>New engine oil</li>
        <li>Hose clamps and fittings (usually come with the kit)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Step 1: Find a Good Spot</h3>
      <p>Look for a safe place to mount the new filter. It should be away from hot parts and moving things. Many people choose the inside of the frame rail or near the radiator support.</p>

      <h3>Step 2: Mount the Filter</h3>
      <p>Use the bracket that comes with your kit to attach the filter to the spot you picked. Make sure it's tight and won't move around.</p>

      </figure>

      <h3>Step 3: Connect the Hoses</h3>
      <p>Attach one hose from the engine's oil pressure port to the filter's inlet. Then, connect another hose from the filter's outlet back to the engine's oil pan or filler cap. Make sure all connections are secure to prevent leaks.</p>

      <h3>Step 4: Fill and Check</h3>
      <p>Fill your engine with new oil. Start the engine and let it run for a few minutes. Check for any leaks around the hoses and fittings. If everything looks good, you're all set!</p>

      <h3>Helpful Tips</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Always use thread sealant on fittings to prevent leaks.</li>
        <li>Keep hoses away from hot engine parts.</li>
        <li>Regularly check the filter and hoses for wear and tear.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Great job! You've added an extra layer of protection to your engine. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out through our <a href="contact.html">contact page</a>.</p>
